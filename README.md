custom_views_nthrow
===================

Custom field for views with optional nth row setting.

This module provides a custom field for views. The custom field behaves similiar to Global Custom Text but
it comes with an option to display only on every certain number of rows.

How to use:

- Create a new View
- Add new field, under Global fields select Global: Custom content every nth row.
- Enter the amount of rows to alternate this field.
- Now in the preview you should see that your custom field appears every # number of rows.
